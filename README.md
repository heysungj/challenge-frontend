# Tapply Coding Challenge: Frontend

Welcome to our frontend coding challenge. In this exercise, you'll create a responsive web app that asks users a series of questions and display their responses on the screen as the questions progress. Here we have an example of one of our intern's completed challenge. [Demo](https://rpgmaker.netlify.app/)

This exercise is designed to give you unlimited creative freedom as you develop a solution/implementation. Feel free to use any frameworks/packages/tools as you see fit; the goal is a functional app with a reasonable amount of CSS stylings. Backend implementation is not required.

Since we use Next.js as our frontend framework, we've included it as part of the repo; if you wish to use it, here's a good [starting point](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app).

## To get started:
1. Fork or clone this repo.
2. Implement your code.
4. Send us a link to your repo for review and please use a free hosting resource such as [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) so that we can review a live version of the challenge.

Happy coding!
